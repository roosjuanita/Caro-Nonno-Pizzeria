PIZZA NAPOLETANA

Ingredients:
- Pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
- 3/4 cup tomato sauce (simple, with olive oil and garlic)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 8–10 anchovy fillets, drained and patted dry
- 1–2 tbsp capers, rinsed
- 1–2 tbsp black olives, pitted and sliced
- Olive oil for drizzling
- Optional: pinch of red pepper flakes

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C); if using a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven now.
2. Roll or stretch the dough into a 10–12 inch circle and place it on a lightly floured peel or baking sheet.
3. Spread tomato sauce evenly, leaving a 1 inch border for the crust.
4. Sprinkle mozzarella over the sauce, then arrange anchovy fillets evenly.
5. Add capers and black olives for extra briny flavor.
6. Bake 8–10 minutes (stone/steel) or 12–14 minutes (baking sheet) until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.
7. Finish with a light drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of red pepper flakes before serving.
