PIZZA MARGHERITA 

Ingredients:
- Pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
- Canned San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand
- Fresh mozzarella (water-packed, torn into pieces)
- Fresh basil (thinly sliced plus a few whole leaves)
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Flaky sea salt 

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C); if using a pizza stone or steel, place it on the top rack.
2. Stretch or roll the dough; spread about 3/4 cup of crushed tomatoes over it, leaving a ~1 inch border.
3. Distribute mozzarella pieces, focusing more in the center so they'll melt evenly.
4. Bake until the crust is golden and cheese bubbles (about 10–12 minutes; less if using stone/steel).
5. Finish with a generous sprinkle of basil, a light drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt (plus optional red pepper flakes).
